# hot-reloading

I was working on adding hot reloading to [Cloudify-Stage](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-stage) repository.
Because I initially failed to do it, maybe because Cloudify-Stage is a large project and have a [multiple webpack configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-multiple-configurations).
I created this repository - to create hot reloading in a small project.
* I used the same versions of `webpack`, `webpack-cli`, `webpack-dev-server`, `babel-loader`, `html-webpack-plugin` as in Cloudify-Stage.
* I created  [multiple webpack configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-multiple-configurations) in this project.
